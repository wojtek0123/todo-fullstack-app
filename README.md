### First fullstack app

I more focued on a logic than a UI or UX.
Created this project to learn graphql, prisma and apollo combined with nextjs and typescript.

### Used technologies:
- NextJS
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Prisma
- Next-auth
- TypeScript
- Tailwindcss
- supabase as database

### How to run this project on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wojtek0123/todo-fullstack-app.git
cd todo-fullstack-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Also you need to create .env file just like .env.example

### To do:

- [x] implement login

- [x] add ability to add, edit, delete tasks

- [x] add styling to login page

- [ ] Add button to mark task as completed and add section for completed tasks

- [ ] improve UI and UX?
